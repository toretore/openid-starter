OpenID starter kit

This Rails application comes preloaded with OpenID authentication
and some other useful things like a SASS stylesheet.

It depends on the ruby-openid and haml gems, which can be installed
using "rake gems:install". It also uses the "open_id_authentication"
plugin from the Rails repo, and a tiny HAML plugin used to initialise
the gem. These are already in vendor/plugins.

Once you have those, all you need to do is copy config/database.yml.example
to config/database.yml and see if the settings are ok, and the app should
be ready for use. The only thing you can do with it is log in and out
using OpenID, but that's why I call it a starter kit :)
